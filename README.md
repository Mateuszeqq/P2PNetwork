# Files Management
To do operations on files, like adding file, sending etc. you have to firstly manually add a file to a folder *files*.
For example if you want to send *example.png* file, you have choose *ADD File* option. Then type file name - *example.png*. 
Finally the program will ask you for the file path. So you should type - *./files/example.png*.
